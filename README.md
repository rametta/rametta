### Hi there :wave:

My name is Jason. I am a software developer in Montreal, Canada.

Some of my favourite libraries I have created:

- :rocket: [SRD](https://github.com/rametta/srd) - Simple Remote Data for Typescript and Javascript projects
- :tumbler_glass: [Pratica](https://github.com/rametta/pratica) - Common Algebraic Data Types
- :horse_racing: [Coppa](https://github.com/rametta/coppa) - CLI tool for local development of google cloud serverless functions
- :spaghetti: [Meatball](https://github.com/rametta/meatball) - Redux middleware for lazily evaluated async side effects

My personal site is [rametta.org](https://rametta.org) where I write about :computer: computer things and the occasional :beer: [brewing recipe](https://rametta.org/brews/).

I have also built:
- :sparkles: [Fuchsia](https://fuchsiacms.com) **Beta** - a headless content management system (CMS).
- :books: [Hugo Mini Course](https://hugo-mini-course.netlify.app/) - a free mini course about building static sites with Hugo. (English/Russian)
- :hamburger: [Yokie](https://yokie.app) - a recipe sharing social media site for people who hate how slow all other recipe sites are.
- :soccer: [Stillo](https://stillo.io) **Beta** - an app for managing all things related to sports teams and leagues.
- :crystal_ball: [FP JS](https://fpjs.surge.sh) - a small browser based text editor that includes many popular functional programming libraries in javascript
