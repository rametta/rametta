### Hi there :wave:

My name is Jason. I am a software developer in Montreal, Canada.

Some of my favourite libraries I have created:

- :tumbler_glass: [Pratica](https://github.com/rametta/pratica)
- :horse_racing: [Coppa](https://github.com/rametta/coppa)
- :spaghetti: [Meatball](https://github.com/rametta/meatball)

My personal site is [rametta.org](https://rametta.org) where I write about :computer: computer things and the occasional :beer: [brewing recipe](https://rametta.org/recipes/how-to-make-mead/).

Currently in my spare time, I am working on building a SAAS headless CMS called :sparkles: [**Fuchsia**](https://fuchsiacms.com). _The planned release date is around Q4 2020._

I have also built:
- :hamburger: [Yokie](https://yokie.app) - a recipe sharing social media site for people who hate how slow all other recipe sites are.
- :soccer: [Stillo](https://stillo.io) **BETA** - an app for managing all things related to sports teams and leagues.
- :crystal_ball: [FP JS](https://fpjs.surge.sh) - a small browser based text editor that includes many popular functional programming libraries in javascript
